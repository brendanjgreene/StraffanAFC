How to Host Your Code
In thi unit the students will learn how to host their Django project on Heroku

HOW TO HOST YOUR CODE

Let’s head over to https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps so we can create a new app. In order to do this, we’ll click on the plus symbol over in the top right hand corner and click on Create new app.

Next we’ll be presented with a new page. You can choose to give your app a name if you wish. This will mean that your app will be hosted at <app name>.herokuapp.com. For this reason the app names need to be unique. You can also select the Runtime. Choose the region nearest to you.

For this example, let’s create a new app called code-institute-social-staging. Let’s also set the Runtime Selection to Europe.

Once you’ve selected a new name and Runtime region, go ahead and click on Create App.

 
Now that we have our app set up, we need to update our SITE_URL, ALLOWED_HOSTS and PAYPAL_NOTIFY_URL to include the new <your-heroku-app>.herokuapp.com domain.
This will bring us the dashboard for our new app. Once we’re here, we can go ahead and open up our project in Pycharm.

As with the Flask app that we deployed to Heroku in Stream 2, we’ll need to use gunicorn to run application on Heroku. We’ll also need to add a Procfile and create a Procfile.local so we can test Heroku locally.

Firstly, let’s go ahead and add gunicorn to the requirements/base.txt:

1
2
...
gunicorn==19.4
If you’re using Mac OS X or a Linux based operating system, you’ll need to install gunicorn now. You can do that by running the following command from your project’s root directory:

pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
This will ensure that all of the development dependencies are installed, including gunicorn.

Next, let’s go create our Procfile. Right-click on the we_are_social directory in Pycharm and add a new file called Procfile:

web: gunicorn we_are_social.wsgi:application
Here we’ll be using Django’s wsgi.py file for our server.

Right-click on the we_are_social directory in Pycharm and add a new file called runtime.txt. In this file add the following line of code which will tell Heroku that you are using Python 2.

python-2.7.12
Mac OS X/Linux:

Next we’ll create our Procfile.local. This is what it should look like for Mac OS X or Linux:

web: gunicorn we_are_social.wsgi:application
Then we need to set the Django environment that we’ll be using locally. This is done by simply running this command from the command line:

export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=settings.dev
Windows:

Next we’ll create our Procfile.local. This what it should look like for Windows:

web: python manage.py runserver
Then we need to set the Django environment that we’ll be using locally. This is done by simply running this command from the command line:

set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=settings.dev
Now that we have that done, we can go ahead and run the following command from the Pycharm terminal:

heroku local -f Procfile.local
And now we should be able to see our app in the browser when we go to localhost:8000.

 
After these changes have been made, they will need to be pushed into the GitHub repository.
Now that we’ve made all the changes needed to get Heroku up and running, we’re going to connect Heroku to our Github account. Open up https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/<your-app-name>/deploy and under the Deployment method heading, click on GitHub.

Once we’ve done that, we’ll be sent to GitHub in order to grant Heroku access. Go ahead and grant Heroku access by clicking the Authorize application.

You may not see the Organization access section unless you’re part of an organization, so you can ignore that section.
Once that’s done, you’ll be able to select the repository that you want to share with Heroku.

Next thing we’ll do is go to the Automatic deploy heading. What we want to achieve here is to tell Heroku to watch out for any changes that occur on the master branch of our GitHub repository and deploy the latest code. In order to this, we select master from the drop down menu.

Once that’s done, go ahead and click Enable Automatic Deploys.

The last thing that we need to do is start our web worker. To do this, first run:

heroku login
Next we’ll need to set our environment on Heroku by running:

heroku config:set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=settings.staging --app <your app name>
This will just update the Heroku configuration that Django will read from.

We’ll also need to run the following:

heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app <your app name>
We need to this because Django will attempt to load all the static files from our own static directory, as well the static files from other sources, such as the admin panel, or Bootstrap forms. We don’t have it set up yet, so the above command will disable the static collection.

Next, run:

heroku ps:scale web=1 --app <your app name>
After that you should be able to see the project open in a new browser tab after you run:

heroku open --app <your app name>
